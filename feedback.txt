The program lacks styling and does not support multiple lists.
Good start to the program but seems like a good template to add more to.
It lacks complexity and creativity.

Agreed with previous group, it is plain and lacks creativity. It
does provide a decent base/template to further develop.
However, it doesn't immidiately allow for a more custom or specific
beginning set up.
